# Code-test
In order to run the program , the user needs to go into testing and press the run button in java after selecting the JSON parse Java.
The program will output the number of countries starting with the letter "t", respectively 2 countries.

I also tried to use Log4j to output the result into a log file as requested and to get the input from the URL directly using get but i ran out of time.

Overall it was not a hard task at all, i know what was required and have an idea of how to implement it.
